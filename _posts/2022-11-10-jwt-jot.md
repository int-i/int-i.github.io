[JSON Web Token (JWT) RFC 7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-1)

```txt
1.  Introduction

   JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact claims representation format
   intended for space constrained environments such as HTTP
   Authorization headers and URI query parameters.  JWTs encode claims
   to be transmitted as a JSON [RFC7159] object that is used as the
   payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS] structure or as the
   plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [JWE] structure, enabling
   the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a
   Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.  JWTs are always
   represented using the JWS Compact Serialization or the JWE Compact
   Serialization.

   The suggested pronunciation of JWT is the same as the English word
   "jot".
